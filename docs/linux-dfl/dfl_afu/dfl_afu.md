# **Accelerator Functional Unit (aka workload) Driver For Host Attach**

Last updated: **May 07, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/fpga?h=master)

**Devices supported**: Stratix 10, Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

This driver extends the capability of the Accelerator Functional Unit or application workload by implementing management features. You can connect to FPGA infrastructure through the AFU's port interface. An application layer, called Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE) is built on top of the AFU driver group and can directly communicate with the AFU port regardless of whether the workload sits in a partial reconfiguration region or not. The AFU driver is composed of 4 source files that define its core functionality.

|Driver|Mapping|Source(s)|Required or Optional DFL Driver?|
|---|---|---|---|

`dfl-afu-dma-region.c` ([Upstream](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/fpga/dfl-afu-dma-region.c?h=master)) provides DMA region management. It can pin/unpin pages in memory for transfers to occur, create/destroy/find DMA regions, and map/unmap regions of memory.

`dfl-afu-error.c` ([Upstream](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/fpga/dfl-afu-error.c?h=master)) handles error reporting from the AFU / Port. It can mask/unmask port errors, clear errors, and show various errors associated with the AFU.

`dfl-afu-region.c` ([Upstream](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/fpga/dfl-afu-region.c?h=master)) provides the portion of the driver responsible for MMIO Region Management. It can add/destroy MMIO regions, and find regions by offset or index.

`dfl-afu-main.c` ([Upstream](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/fpga/dfl-afu-main.c?h=master)) handles management capabilities of the AFU / Port. It can enable/disable/reset AFU ports, open/close/probe access to AFU devices, and show the current state of the AFU's power consumption, `userclk` frequency, and AFU ID, and provides various other capabilities related to port management.

## **Accelerator Functional Unit**

The AFU region is the region where a user can put their custom application logic.  It can optionally contain a Partial Reconfiguration region for dynamic workload updates.
