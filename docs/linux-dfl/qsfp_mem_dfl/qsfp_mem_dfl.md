# **Memory Based QSFP Support Driver for Host Attach**

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Stratix 10, Arria 10 GX

## **Introduction**

This legacy driver builds on top of the QSFP Module and Ethernet IP drivers and enables them in a DFL design. This DFL-based driver will shadow the QSFP module's memory pages in memory. It leverages the core driver code from `qsfp-mem-core.ko`.
