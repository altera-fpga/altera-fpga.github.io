# **Device Feature List Driver**

Last updated: **December 03, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/fpga/dfl.c?h=master)

**Devices supported**: Stratix 10, Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

This driver defines a feature list structure that creates a linked list of feature headers (DFHs) within the MMIO space to provide an extensible way of adding features for FPGA. The driver can walk through feature headers to enumerate feature devices (e.g. FPGA Management Engine, Port and Accelerator Function Unit) and their private features for FPGA devices that support the DFL structure. This linked list is then itself traversed and each feature/private feature is associated with a driver.

An example DFL:

Also known as the DFL "walker", `dfl-ko` walks the DFL and instantiates other DFL-enabled drivers. The same driver is used on both host-attach and in HPS, assuming they are connected by either a soft or hard PCIe IP. The same DFL walker is used regardless of the chosen OFS attach method (PCIe Attach, Direct Attach). This driver is required for all DFL-enabled FPGA designs.
