## **Introduction**

This driver for the 16550 Compatible UART Core to establish TTY communications to FPGA through PCIe.


## **16550 Compatible UART Core** 

The 16550 UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) soft IP core with Avalon® interface is designed to be register space compatible with the de-facto standard 16550 found in the PC industry. The core provides RS-232 Signaling interface, False start detection, Modem control signal and registers, Receiver error detection and Break character generation/detection. The core also has an Avalon® Memory-Mapped ( Avalon® -MM) agent interface that allows Avalon® -MM host peripherals (such as Nios® II and Nios® V processors) to communicate with the core simply by reading and writing control and data registers. For information regarding this soft IP core, please refer to the [Embedded Peripherals IP User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683130/latest/fpga-16550-compatible-uart-core.html).
