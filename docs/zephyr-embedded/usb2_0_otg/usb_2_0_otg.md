# **USB 2.0 OTG Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **May 21, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

Universal Serial Bus (USB) is used to connect peripheral devices to HPS. The USB 2.0 OTG (On-The-Go) IP supports host mode, device mode and OTG mode. However, in both Agilex 7 and Agilex 5, the IP was tested in host mode with support for Mass Storage Class (MSC) integrated with a FAT32 file system. This would enable us to do file operations on an attached device.
The below diagram represents the block diagram of the USB 2.0 controller connected with other components in the system.

## **Features**

* Supports all USB 2.0 speeds.
* Integrated scatter-gather DMA supports moving data between memory and the controller either in buffer DMA mode or scatter-gather DMA mode depending on the controllerâ€™s function.
* Supports USB 2.0 in ULPI mode.
* Supports all USB transaction types.
* Supports up to 16 endpoints, including bidirectional control endpoint.
* Only a single line interrupt is used from a USB OTG instance.

## **Driver Capabilities**

* Control and Bulk endpoints are supported in host mode.
* Auto enumeration support is enabled.
* Supports Mass Storage Class which is integrated with FAT 32 file system in host mode.
* Hot plugging feature is supported.
