# **Clock Manager Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **May 25, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: No

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

Hard Processor System (HPS) clock generation is centralized in the clock manager. The clock manager is responsible for providing software-programmable clock control to configure all clocks generated in the HPS. Clocks are organized into clock groups.

A clock group is a set of clock signals that originate from the same clock source which may be synchronous to each other. The Clock Manager has a two Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) clock group where the clock source is a common PLL voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). A clock group which is independent and asynchronous to other clocks may only have a single clock, also known as clock slice. Peripheral clocks are a group of independent clock slices.

For more information please refer to the [Intel Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346).

## **Features**

* Generates and manages clocks in the HPS.
* Contains two flexible PLL blocks Main PLL and Peripheral PLL.
* Generates clock gate controls for enabling and disabling most of the clocks.
* Allows software to program clock characteristics.
* Supports interrupting the Cortex-A53 MPCore on PLL-lock and loss-of-lock.
