# **A Modular Scatter-Gather DMA (mSGDMA) Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **December 11, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

In a processor subsystem, data transfers between two memory spaces can happen frequently. In order to offload the processor from moving data around a system, a Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine is introduced to perform this function instead. The Modular Scatter-Gather DMA (mSGDMA) is capable of performing data movement operations with preloaded instructions, called descriptors. Multiple descriptors with different transfer sizes, and source and destination addresses have the option to trigger interrupts.

## **mSGDMA FPGA IP**

The mSGDMA provides three configuration structures for handling data transfers: between the Avalon-MM to Avalon-MM, Avalon-MM to Avalon-ST, and Avalon-ST to Avalon-MM. The sub-core of the mSGDMA is instantiated automatically according to the structure configured for the mSGDMA use model. For more information on MSGDMA IP core please refer to [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683130/23-1/modular-scatter-gather-dma-core.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683130/23-1/modular-scatter-gather-dma-core.html).
