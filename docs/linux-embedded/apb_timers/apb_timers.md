# **General-Purpose Timers Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **February 12, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/clocksource/dw_apb_timer.c)

**Device Supported**: Agilex 5 , Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

The Hard Processor System (HPS) provides four 32-bit general-purpose timers connected to the level 4 (L4) peripheral bus. The timers optionally generate an interrupt when the 32-bit binary count-down timer reaches zero.

For more information please refer to the [Intel Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346).
