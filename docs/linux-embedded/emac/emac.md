# **Ethernet Media Access Controller (EMAC) Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **May 25, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The Ethernet Media Access Controller (EMAC) Driver controls initialization, configuration and traffic shaping of the three EMACs in the Hard Processor System (HPS).

| Driver | Capability |
|:-------|:----------|
| /drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac-socfpga.c | Sets PHY layer configuration such as GMII, RGMII, RMII and speed. |
| /drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_platform.c | Obtains the features EMAC features supported to main driver |
| /drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c | Sets ethtool operations<br> Initializes hardware<br> Initializes traffic control<br> Calls networking API (NAPI)<br> Registers IP as netdev<br> Initialize PHY, DMA, MAC Transaction Layer, Management MAC counters, Precision Time Protocol, Watchdog Timer, Ring Length, PCS protocol and TCP Segmentation Offload | 
| /drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/hwif.c | Initializes hardware interface and obtains device ID and IP version |
| /drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwxgmac2_core.c | Configures filters, link speed, MDIO/MII bus |
| /drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_mdio.c | Provides bus interface for MII registers |

The following group of drivers is required to support EMAC functionality:

### **EMAC IP**

The hard processor system (HPS) provides three Ethernet media access controller
(EMAC) peripherals.
Each EMAC can be used to transmit and receive data at 10M/100M/1G/2.5G speeds
over Ethernet connections in compliance with the IEEE 802.3-2018 specification and
enable support for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) applications.

The EMAC has an extensive memory-mapped Control and Status Register (CSR) set,
which can be accessed by the on-board Arm processors.

The EMAC is an integration of the Synopsys Ethernet XGMAC IP with the SMTG hub and
external memory. The EMAC can be accessed from HPS or FPGA fabric over an AXI
interface. For more information please refer to the [Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346).

* IEEE 1588-2008 Advanced Timestamp: Precision Time Protocol (PTP), 2-steps, PTP offload and timestamping
* IEEE 802.1AS: Timing and synchronization
* IEEE 802.1Qav: Time-sensitive streams forwarding queuing
* The XGMAC supports the following features
  * Full-duplex operation at 10M/100M/1G/2.5 Gbps (GMII)
  * Full-duplex RGMII support (10M/100M/1 G)
  * Half-duplex operation in 10/100 Mbps modes
  * Separate transmission, reception, and configuration (control and status register) interfaces to the application
  * MDIO interface for multiple PHY devices and their configuration and management
  * Programmable frame length, supporting standard or jumbo Ethernet frames up to 9 KB
