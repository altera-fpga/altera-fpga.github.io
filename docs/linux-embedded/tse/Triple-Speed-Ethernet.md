**Upstream Status**: Upstreamed

**Devices supported**:Agilex 5,  Agilex 7, Stratix10, Cyclone V

## **Introduction**

The Triple-Speed Ethernet, SGDMA, and MSGDMA components are all soft IP components that can be assembled and built into an FPGA using the Altera Quartus toolchain. The controller uses the SGDMA and MSGDMA soft DMA IP components.

### **Triple Speed Ethernet Overview**

The Triple-Speed Ethernet FPGA IP core consists of a 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet media access control (MAC) and physical coding sublayer (PCS) Intellectual Property (IP). This IP function enables FPGAs to interface to an external Ethernet PHY device, which interfaces to the Ethernet network.

This IP is offered in MAC-only mode or in MAC+PHY mode. In the MAC only mode, the IP uses an external PHY chip to do signaling. The two supported interfaces to the external PHYs are: GMII (8-bit interface at 125 MHz SDR) and RGMII (4-bit interface at 125 MHz DDR).

In the MAC+PHY mode, the PHY is realized using on-chip transceivers or LVDS I/O with dynamic phase alignment (DPA) logic that can operate up to 1.25 Gbps. SGMII or 1000Base-X protocol is used in this case. The usage of LVDS I/Os enables very scalable multiport gigabit Ethernet (GbE) system designs while saving the serial transceivers for higher performance protocols.
