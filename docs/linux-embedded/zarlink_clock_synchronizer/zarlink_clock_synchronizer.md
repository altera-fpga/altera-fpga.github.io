# **Zarlink Clock Synchronizer Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **August 14, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

The Microchip&reg; Zarlink ZL30733 3-Channel SyncE & 1588 Network Synchronizer takes charge of frequency synchronization, monitors reference clock quality, manages reference clock switching, and provides holdover functionality for SyncE and PTP1588 support. It has support for multiple reference clocks and can be used to generate the outputs. The device is constantly monitoring the quality of the reference clocks and it switches to an alternative clock source when the measured period of the current reference signal is incorrect, or if it has excessive jitter.
