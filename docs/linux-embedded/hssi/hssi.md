# **Ethernet Subsystem (HSSI) Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **November 27, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

The Ethernet Subsystem FPGA IP driver acts as a bridge between the software operating in the HPS and the Ethernet Subsystem within the FPGA. It provides various levels of abstraction to simplify communication with the underlying Ethernet Subsystem IP. The Ethernet Subsystem driver exposes Ethernet `netdev` driver APIs that higher-level software layers can utilize to interact with the Ethernet Subsystem IP

## **Ethernet Subsystem FPGA IP**

The Ethernet Subsystem FPGA IP is a subsystem IP that includes a configurable,
Media Access Control (MAC) and Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) presenting a
consistent interface to user logic. It consists of 20 ports. Depending on the tile chosen,
each port is implemented based on either the Agilex® 7 E-Tile Hard IP for
Ethernet FPGA IP Core or the F-Tile Hard IP for Ethernet FPGA IP core.

This IP provides a seamless and fast way to instantiate a multi-port design, given that
it integrates the required discrete Hard IP and Soft IP ingredients. Furthermore, the
Subsystem IP provides a user interface to facilitate enabling required features and
parameters of operation.

For E-Tile, this subsystem IP provides Ethernet data rate profiles of 10Gbps, 25Gbps,
and 100Gbps with optional RS-FEC and 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP). The
subsystem also provides profiles for PCS, OTN, FlexE and CPRI.

For F-Tile, this subsystem IP provides Ethernet data rate profiles of 10Gbps, 25Gbps,
40Gbps, 50Gbps, 100Gbps, 200Gbps, and 400Gbps with optional RS-FEC and 1588
Precision Time Protocol (PTP). Quartus® Prime software version 23.2 supports
only Media Access Control (MAC) and Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) sub-profile.
