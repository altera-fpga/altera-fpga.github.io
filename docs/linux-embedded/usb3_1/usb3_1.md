# **USB 3.1 Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **February 11, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The HPS provides a single instance of a USB 3.1 Gen 1 controller that supports both device and host functions for high-speed applications. The general use cases of USB 3.1 are for the HPS system to support all USB devices such as:

* Portable electronic devices
* High-bandwidth applications like audio and video.
* Debug trace applications
