# **QSFP Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **December 06, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

The QSFP driver is responsible for interacting with the onboard QSFP module. It reads the QSFP Serial Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (SEEP) and controls the power and interrupt pins of the QSFP.

## **Driver Sources**

The source code for this driver can be found at [https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga/blob/socfpga-5.15.90-lts-ftile-1588ptp/drivers/net/phy/qsfp.c](https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga/blob/socfpga-5.15.90-lts-ftile-1588ptp/drivers/net/phy/qsfp.c).

## **Driver Capabilities**

* Registers QSFP driver to kernel.
* Reads the registers through the I2C bus and provide information to high level software stack.
