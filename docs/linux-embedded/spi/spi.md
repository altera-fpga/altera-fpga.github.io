# **SPI Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **September 23, 2024** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/spi)

**Devices supported**: Agilex7, Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

Serial master and serial slave controllers Enable serial communication with serial-master or serial-slave peripheral devices.
Each SPI master has a maximum bit rate of 60 Mbps.
Each SPI slave has a maximum bit rate of 33.33 Mbps.
The DMA controller interface is integrated with the HPS DMA controller.
