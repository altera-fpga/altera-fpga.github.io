# **Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **September 11, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/edac/altera_edac.c)

**Devices supported**: Agilex3, Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) driver supports use of the Error Checking and Correction (ECC) Controller in the HPS.  The ECC controllers are implemented in the on-chip RAM, USB OTG 2.0 and 3.1 and Ethernet MACs in the HPS.  To find out more about the ECC controller please refer to the [Hard Processor Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346).

## **Driver Sources**

The source code for the driver can be found at [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/edac/altera_edac.c](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/edac/altera_edac.c).

## **Driver Capabilities**


The Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) driver comprises the ECC manager main component and sub-components of the supported EDAC SoC components.

The driver's main functions are to register the EDAC platform drivers in Linux, initialize the EDAC sub-components by performing initial setup of the IRQ interrupt handlers and soft-error handling for uncorrected error events, and to support debugging features like soft-error injections and reads of the error counters.
