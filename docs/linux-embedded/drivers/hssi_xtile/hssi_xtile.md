# **Ethernet Subsystem Intel FPGA IP Tile Specific Ethernet MAC Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **July 18, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

The Ethernet MAC driver is used to manage the configuration parameters of the particular tile. It currently supports F-tile and E-tile of the Ethernet Subsystem Intel FPGA IP

## **F-tile and E-tile FPGA IP**

To get more information on F-tile Hard IP please refer to the [F-tile Architecture and PMA and FEC Direct PHY IP User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683872/23-4-4-7-0/f-tile-overview.html).

And for E-tile Hard IP please refer to the [E-Tile Hard IP User Guide: E-Tile Hard IP for Ethernet and E-Tile CPRI PHY IPs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683468/23-2/intel-fpga-ip-overview.html).
