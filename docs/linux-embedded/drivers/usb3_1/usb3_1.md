# **USB 3.1 Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **October 06, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/dwc3)

**Devices supported**: Agilex3, Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The HPS provides a single instance of a USB 3.1 Gen 1 controller that supports both device and host functions for high-speed applications. The general use cases of USB 3.1 are for the HPS system to support all USB devices such as:

* Portable electronic devices
* High-bandwidth applications like audio and video.
* Debug trace applications

For More information please refer to the following link:

[Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346)

### USB 3.1 Glue Driver

`drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-of-simple.c` is a USB glue driver for the `dw3-agilex-edge.c` component depicted in the diagram below. This glue driver is used to control dynamic mode switching.

## **Driver Sources**

The source code for this driver can be found at:

[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/dwc3](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/dwc3)

## **Driver Capabilities**

* It provides a reference to the Clock which is required by the rest of the interfaces.

## **Kernel Configurations**

CONFIG_USB_DWC3

![usb_3_config_path](images/usb_3_config_path.png)

**Note**: 
CONFIG_USB_DWC3_HOST or CONFIG_USB_DWC3_GADGET should be enabled only if the user wants to explicitly turn on Host or Device mode.
If CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is enabled, both Host mode and Device mode drivers will be built.

## **Device Tree**

Example Device tree location to configure the usb3_1:

1\. The default Device Tree configures the USB3_1 in Host Mode: (dr_mode = "host";)

[https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga/blob/socfpga-6.1.55-lts/arch/arm64/boot/dts/intel/socfpga_agilex5.dtsi](https://github.com/altera-opensource/linux-socfpga/blob/socfpga-6.1.55-lts/arch/arm64/boot/dts/intel/socfpga_agilex5.dtsi)

```
		usb31: usb1@11000000 {
			compatible = "intel,agilex5-dwc3";
			reg = <0x11000000 0x100000>;
			ranges;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&clkmgr AGILEX5_USB31_SUSPEND_CLK>,
				 <&clkmgr AGILEX5_USB31_BUS_CLK_EARLY>;
			resets = <&rst USB1_RESET>, <&rst USB1_OCP_RESET>;
			reset-names = "dwc3", "dwc3-ecc";
			status = "disabled";

			usb@11000000{
				compatible = "snps,dwc3";
				reg = <0x11000000 0x100000>;
				interrupts = <GIC_SPI 94 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
				phys = <&usbphy0>, <&usbphy0>;
				phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";
				dr_mode = "host";
				maximum-speed = "super-speed-plus";
				snps,dis_u2_sysphy-quirk;
				snps,dma_set_40_bit_mask_quirk;
			};
		};
```

2\. To enable the USB3_1 in Device Mode, the "dr_mode" must be changed to "peripheral" in the Device Tree File:


```
		usb31: usb1@11000000 {
			compatible = "intel,agilex5-dwc3";
			reg = <0x11000000 0x100000>;
			ranges;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&clkmgr AGILEX5_USB31_SUSPEND_CLK>,
				 <&clkmgr AGILEX5_USB31_BUS_CLK_EARLY>;
			resets = <&rst USB1_RESET>, <&rst USB1_OCP_RESET>;
			reset-names = "dwc3", "dwc3-ecc";
			status = "disabled";

			usb@11000000{
				compatible = "snps,dwc3";
				reg = <0x11000000 0x100000>;
				interrupts = <GIC_SPI 94 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
				phys = <&usbphy0>, <&usbphy0>;
				phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";
				dr_mode = "peripheral";
				maximum-speed = "super-speed-plus";
				snps,dis_u2_sysphy-quirk;
				snps,dma_set_40_bit_mask_quirk;
			};
		};
```

3\. To enable the USB3_1 in Dual-Role Device (DRD) Mode.

a. The "dr_mode" must be changed to "otg" in the Device Tree File

```
		usb31: usb1@11000000 {
			compatible = "intel,agilex5-dwc3";
			reg = <0x11000000 0x100000>;
			ranges;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&clkmgr AGILEX5_USB31_SUSPEND_CLK>,
				 <&clkmgr AGILEX5_USB31_BUS_CLK_EARLY>;
			resets = <&rst USB1_RESET>, <&rst USB1_OCP_RESET>;
			reset-names = "dwc3", "dwc3-ecc";
			status = "disabled";

			usb@11000000{
				compatible = "snps,dwc3";
				reg = <0x11000000 0x100000>;
				interrupts = <GIC_SPI 94 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
				phys = <&usbphy0>, <&usbphy0>;
				phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";
				dr_mode = "otg";
				maximum-speed = "super-speed-plus";
				snps,dis_u2_sysphy-quirk;
				snps,dma_set_40_bit_mask_quirk;
			};
		};
```

b. Two extra nodes are to be added to the Device Tree File:

(User may add to gsrd-socfpga//meta-intel-fpga-refdes/recipes-bsp/device-tree/files/socfpga_agilex5_ghrd.dtsi)


```
        usb_pio: gpio@20010090 {
                compatible = "altr,pio-1.0";
                reg = <0x20010090 0x10>;
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 20 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
                altr,gpio-bank-width = <4>;
                altr,interrupt-type = <3>;
                #gpio-cells = <2>;
                gpio-controller;
        };

        extcon_usb: extcon-usb {
                compatible = "linux,extcon-usb-gpio";
                id-gpio = <&usb_pio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                vbus-gpio = <&usb_pio 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        };
```
