# **Ethernet 1588 PTP Time of Day Clock IP Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **July 07, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7

## **Introduction**

The driver for the Ethernet 1588 PTP Time of Day Clock FPGA IP is used in the 1588 PTP Design examples provided by Altera. The Time of Day Clock FPGA IP is exposed as a PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) device to the Linux PTP stack to synchronize the system clock to its ToD information using `phc2sys` utility in the Linux PTP stack.

## **Time of Day Clock FPGA IP**

The Time-of-day (TOD) Clock streams 96-bit and 64-bit time-of-day to one or more time stamping units in an IEEE 1588v2 solution. For information regarding this soft IP core, please refer to the [Ethernet Design Example Components User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683044/latest/time-of-day-clock.html).
