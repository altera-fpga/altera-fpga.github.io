# **Reset Manager Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **June 21, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: Not Upstreamed

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The reset manager generates module reset signals based on reset requests from various sources in the HPS, and performs software writing to the module-reset control registers.

The HPS contains multiple reset domains. Each reset domain can be reset
independently. A reset can be initiated externally, internally, or through software.  For more information about the reset manager, please refer to the [Intel Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346).
