# **Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC) Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **July 18, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/dma/dw-axi-dmac/dw-axi-dmac-platform.c)

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The DMAC driver supports two DMACs with a maximum of four channels each. This driver transfers data between memory and peripherals and other memory locations in the system.

## **HPS Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC)**

The DMAC is part of the Hard Processor System (HPS) of the FPGA.  The HPS provides two DMACs to handle the data transfer between memory-mapped peripherals and memories, off-loading this work from the MPU system complex. Some common features are listed below.

* Software programmable with dedicated register field
* Supports multiple transfer types
* Each DMAC channels supports four channels
* Each DMAC supports interrupt interface to the Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC)
* Supports up to 48 peripheral request interfaces
