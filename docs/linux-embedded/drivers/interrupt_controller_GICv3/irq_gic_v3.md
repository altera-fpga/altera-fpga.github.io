# **Interrupt controller (GICv3) Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **September 08, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/irqchip/irq-gic-v3.c)

**Devices supported**: Agilex3, Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The interrupt controller driver handles general initialization of the interrupt controller in the HPS.

The Arm&reg; Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) handles interrupts from peripherals to the cores and between cores. To find out more about the features and functions of the GIC controller, please refer to [Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346)

## **Driver Capabilities**


* Initialize and configure the GICv3 interrupt controller hardware during system boot-up.
* Handles interrupts generated by various sources in the system.
* Routes interrupt from their sources to the appropriate CPU cores.
* Provides generic API to manage interrupts.
* Support distributed interrupts across multiple GIC instances.
