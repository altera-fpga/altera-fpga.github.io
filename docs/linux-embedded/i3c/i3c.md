# **I3C Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **February 20, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/i3c/master/dw-i3c-master.c)

**Devices supported**: Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The I3C controller device driver only supports running as a master. The main master is a specialized master that comes up after power-on-reset, and is responsible for assigning dynamic addresses to the I3C devices. The secondary master is an I3C instance capable of both master and slave functionality. It comes up as a slave upon power-on-reset. The secondary master must get ownership of the I3C bus to become a current master before initiating any transfer to its associated slaves.

I3C slave controller is not supported. The latest Linux kernel does not support the slave I3C framework.

I3C master controller slave DMA is not be supported even though I3C also supports external DMA. The latest Linux kernel does not support DMA.

## **I3C FPGA IP**

The I3C interface is a high-bandwidth bus interface for connecting peripherals to HPS. The I3C interface is intended to improve upon the features of the I2C interface, while preserving backward compatibility. This interface is targeted for applications such as event camera sensors which require I3C interface capability.

The hard processor system (HPS) provides two I3C controllers to enable system software to communicate serially with I3C buses. For information regarding this soft IP core, please refer to the [Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346).

## **Known Issues**

* I3C slave controller shall not be supported. The latest Linux kernel does not support the slave i3c framework.
* I3C master controller slave DMA shall not be supported even-though I3C also supports external DMA. The latest Linux kernel does not support DMA
