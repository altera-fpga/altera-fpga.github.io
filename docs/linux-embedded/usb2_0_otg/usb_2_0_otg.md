# **USB 2.0 OTG Driver for Hard Processor System**

Last updated: **March 18, 2025** 

**Upstream Status**: [Upstreamed](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/usb/dwc2)

**Devices supported**: Agilex 7, Agilex 5

## **Introduction**

The hard processor system (HPS) provides a USB On-The-Go (OTG) controller that
supports both device and host functions. The controller is fully compliant with the On
The Go and Embedded Host Supplement to the USB Revision 1.3 and Revision 2.0
Specification. The controller can be programmed for both device and host functions to
support data movement over the USB protocol
