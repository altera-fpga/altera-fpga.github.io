The **kernel.itb** file is a Flattattened Image Tree (FIT) file that includes the following components:

* Linux kernel.
* Board configurations* that indicate what components from the **kernel.itb** (Linux kernel, device tree and Phase 2 FPGA configuration bitstream) should be used for a specific board.
* Linux device tree*.
* Phase 2 FPGA configuration bitstream*.

 \* One or more of these components to support the different board configurations.

The **kernel.itb** is created from a **.its** (Image Tree Source file) that describes its structure. In the GSRD 2.0, the  **kernel.itb** file is generated in the following directory. In this directory you can also find the **.its** files and all other the components needed to create the **kernel.itb** :

* **$TOP_FOLDER/<*gsrd-directory*>/<*project-directory*>/software/yocto_linux/build/tmp/work/<*device*>-poky-linux/linux-socfpga-lts/<*linux-branch*>+git/linux-<*device*>-standard-build/**

As an example of this path, for the Agilex 5 device you will find this directory as
$TOP_FOLDER/a5ed065es-premium-devkit-oobe/baseline-a55/software/yocto_linux/build/tmp/work/agilex5e-poky-linux/linux-socfpga-lts/6.12.43-lts+git/linux-agilex5e-standard-build

If you want to modify the **kernel.itb** by replacing one of the component or modifying any board configuration, you can do the following:

1. Install **mtools** package in your Linux machine.
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt install mtools
   ```
   
2. Go to the folder in which the **kernel.itb** is being created under the GSRD.
   ```bash
   $ cd $TOP_FOLDER/<gsrd-directory>/<project-directory>/software/yocto_linux/build/tmp/work/<device>-poky-linux/linux-socfpga-lts/<linux-branch>+git/linux-<device>-standard-build/
   $ ls *.its
   fit_<device>_kernel_.its
   ```
   
3. In the **.its** file, observe the components that integrates the kernel.itb identifying the nodes as indicated next:

   **images** node:<br>
   - **kernel** node - Linux kernel defined with the **data** parameter in the node.<br>
   - **fdt-X** node    - Device tree X defined with the **data** parameter in the node.<br>
   - **fpga-X** node -  Phase 2 FPGA configuration bitstream .rbf defined with the **data** parameter in the node. 

   **configurations** node:<br>
   - **board-X** node - Board configuration with the name defined with the **description** parameter. The components for a specific board configuration are defined with the **kernel**, **fdt** and **fpga** parameters.   

4. In this directory, you can replace any of the file components that integrate the **kernel.itb**, or you can also modify the **.its** to change the structure and components of the kernel.itb.

5. Finally, you need to re-generate the new **kernel.itb** running the following command in the same **linux-<device>-standard-build/** directory.
   ```bash
   $ rm kernel.itb
   $ mkimage -f fit_<device>_kernel.its kernel.itb
   ```

Once that you have completed this procedure, you can use the new **kernel.itb** as needed. Some options could be:

* Use U-Boot to load this into the SDRAM board through TFTP to boot Linux or to write it to a flash device
* Directly update the flash image in your board (QSPI, SD Card, eMMC or NAND) from your working machine.
