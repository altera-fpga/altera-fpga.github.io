The **kernel.itb** file is a Flattattened Image Tree (FIT) file that includes the following components:

* Linux kernel.
* Several board configurations that indicate what components from the **kernel.itb** (Linux kernel, device tree and 2nd Phase fabric design) should be used for a specific board.
* Linux device tree*.
* 2nd Phase Fabric Design*.

 \* One or more of these components to support the different board configurations.

The **kernel.itb** is created from a **.its** (Image Tree Source file) that describes its structure. In the GSRD, the  **kernel.itb** file is located in the following directory, where you can find also all the components needed to create it, including the .its file:

* **$TOP_FOLDER/gsrd-socfpga/<*device-devkit*>-gsrd-rootfs/tmp/work/<*device-devkit*>-poky-linux/linux-socfpga-lts/<*linux branch*>+git/linux-<*device devkit*>-standard-build/**

If you want to modify the kernel.itb by replacing one of the component or modifying any board configuration, you can do the following:

1. Install **mtools** package in your Linux machine.
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt install mtools
   ```
   
2. Go to the in which the **kernel.itb** is being created under the GSRD.
   ```bash
   $ cd $TOP_FOLDER/gsrd-socfpga/<device-devkit>-gsrd-rootfs/tmp/work/<device-devkit>-poky-linux/linux-socfpga-lts/<linux branch>+git/linux-<device-devkit>-standard-build/
   $ ls *.its
   fit_kernel_<device-devkit>.its
   ```
   
3. In the .its file, observe the components that integrates the kernel.itb identifying the nodes as indicated next:

   **images** node:<br>
   - **kernel** node - Linux kernel defined with the **data** parameter in the node.<br>
   - **fdt-X** node    - Device tree X defined with the **data** parameter in the node.<br>
   - **fpga-X** node -  2nd Phase FPGA Configuration .rbf defined with the **data** parameter in the node.
   
   **configurations** node:<br>
   - **board-X** node - Board configuration with the name defined with the **description** parameter. The components for a specific board configuration are defined with the **kernel**, **fdt** and **fpga** parameters.   

4. In this directory, you can replace any of the files corresponding to any of the components that integrate the **kernel.itb**, or you can also modify the **.its** to change the name/location of any of the components or change the board configuration.

5. Finally, you need to re-generate the new **kernel.itb** as indicated next.
   ```bash
   $ rm kernel.itb
   $ mkimage -f fit_kernel_<device-devkit>.its kernel.itb
   ```

At this point you can use the new **kernel.itb** as needed. Some options could be:

* Use U-Boot to bring it to your SDRAM board through TFTP to boot Linux or to write it to a SD Card device
* Update the flash image (QSPI, SD Card, eMMC or NAND) from your working machine.
