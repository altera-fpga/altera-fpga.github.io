## Reconfiguring Core Fabric from U-Boot
The GSRD configures the FPGA core fabric only once, from U-Boot, by using the **bootm** command. The example in this page configures the fabric only once, from U-Boot, using **fpga load** command.

**Important**: If the FPGA fabric is already configured and bridges are enabled, you must call the **bridge disable** command from U-Boot before issuing the **bootm** or **fppga load** commands to reconfigure the fabric. Only do this if you are using an **arm-trusted-firmware** version more recent than the following:

* v2.7.1 = https://github.com/altera-opensource/arm-trusted-firmware/commit/0a5edaed853e0dc1e687706ccace8e844b2a8db7
* v2.8.0 = https://github.com/altera-opensource/arm-trusted-firmware/commit/bf933536d4582d63d0e29434e807a641941f3937
