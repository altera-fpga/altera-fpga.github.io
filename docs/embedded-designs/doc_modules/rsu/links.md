<!--This file is used for listing inter-document links in the embedded-designs folder.  Create a live link when you want to ensure the naming of the file is always the same.  Share your agreed upon bracketed document name with others in this link file and whenever it is listed, the correct active links will be populated in the document.  This links.md also helps if the link path changes, so you don't have to go back and change all of your documentation.  Steps to get this to work are:
1. Decide on document name.
2. Decide where your link should go.  If it is a global document name put it in the docs_module folder.  If it is a interdocument link within a certain folder such as "embedded-designs" then create a links.md in the top folder, such as /docs/embedded-designs/doc_modules/links.md and place your link there.
3. Format the links as such (this is just an example):
[GSRD User Manual]: https://altera-fpga.github.io/rel-24.2/docs/embedded-designs/agilex-5/e-series/premium/gsrd/ug-gsrd-agx5e-premium/
In the above example, user only needs to include [GSRD User Manual] in document for live link to work.-->
