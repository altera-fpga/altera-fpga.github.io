# ROS Consolidated Robot Controller Example Design for Agilex™ 5 Devices

## Overview
This example design demonstrates:

* [ROS 2](https://www.ros.org/) running on the Hard Processor System (HPS) in a Docker container.
* Embedded real-time 6-Axis motor control in the FPGA fabric.
* Robot control leveraging [ROS 2](https://www.ros.org/), [MoveIt2](https://moveit.ai/) and integration with Drive-on-Chip FPGA IP.

<br>
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. In this example design we demonstrate a [ROS 2](https://www.ros.org/) based, 6-axis robot controller running on the Agilex™ 5 FPGA E-Series Modular Development Kit. Motor drives and control is handled by a [6-axis Drive-on-Chip design](https://github.com/altera-fpga/agilex-ed-drive-on-chip/tree/main/HPS_NIOSVg_DoC_3x2_axis) integrated with ROS 2 through a [ROS Control hardware interface](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2/tree/main/fpga_doc_control_driver). [MoveIt2](https://moveit.ai/) is used to provide path planning capabilities along with collision avoidance and scene mapping. A basic [MoveIt client](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2/tree/main/examples/moveit_demo_client) is provided which employs a simulated [UFACTORY Lite 6 robot arm](https://www.ufactory.cc/lite-6-collaborative-robot/).

* Power supply
* Micro USB Cable
* Network cables
* Micro SD card and reader

!!! note
    A separate PC running Linux with display out is required to setup the Agilex™ 5 development kit and run the ROS Visualizer (RViz).

### Software Requirements

* Host PC
  * Linux OS
  * Serial terminal
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  * Altera® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition Version 25.1 Programmer and Tools

## Getting Started

There are 3 main components to this example design which are described below.

#### FPGA Drive-on-Chip Design
This example uses the [6-axis Drive-on-Chip design](https://github.com/altera-fpga/agilex-ed-drive-on-chip/tree/main/HPS_NIOSVg_DoC_3x2_axis) variant for FPGA based motor control. See [HERE](./doc-crc/hw-funct-descr.md) for more information on the design.

#### Hard Processor System (HPS) Linux Image
A custom Linux image is provided to support the Drive-on-Chip FPGA design which includes Docker and other dependencies for successfully deploying this example. The FPGA bitstream is included in the Linux image and flashed by the first-stage bootloader on boot. The Yocto layers and configuration files used to build the image can be found [HERE](https://github.com/altera-fpga/agilex-ed-drive-on-chip/tree/rel/25.1/sw).

#### ROS 2 Docker Image
A Docker build script is provided in the [Altera ROS 2](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2) repository in order to build a Docker image with the required software components to run this example. The Docker image is run on the HPS and also the host PC if visualizing the robot arm.

### Prebuilt Binaries
Prebuilt binaries are provided to help get the example design running quickly. You can find links to the required binaries below.

### Setting Up your Development Board


* Configure the board switches:
  The following provides the default configuration for all the switches in the
  board.

![board-1](./common/images/board-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Development Board switch position**
</center>
<br>

!!! note "Main configurations used in this example design"

    JTAG:     SOM SW4[2:1]=OFF:OFF <br>
    ASx4 (QSPI):  SOM SW4[2:1]=ON:ON

<br>

* Connect micro USB cable from bottom left of the carrier board to PC (`J35`).
  This will be used for JTAG communication (see figure below).
* Connect micro USB cable from bottom right of the SOM board to PC
  (`J2`, HSP_UART). This will be used for HPS UART communication. Look at what
  ports are enumerated on your host computer, there should be a series of
  four. Use the 3rd one in the list as the HPS serial port (see figure below).
* If ethernet capabilities or remote connection via `ssh` is required connect an
  ethernet cable to the ethernet port on the SOM board (`J6`, ETH 1G HPS) and make
  sure your device is in the same network as your intended host device. After
  Linux boots, check the IP address of the `end2` ethernet interface using the
  `ip addr` command.

### SD Card Image Flashing

* Download SD card image (`.wic` or `.wic.gz`) from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Write the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` SD card image to the micro SD card using one of the options below.
* Turn off the board and insert the SD card in the micro SD card slot on the SOM board.

#### [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)

* Open [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) and click the `...` button in the top right.
* Select the image you downloaded earlier and click `Open`.
* Next select the device associated with your SD card reader from the drop-down list.
* Click `Write` to start flashing.

#### [bmaptool](https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool) (Linux)

!!! note
    You will require a `.wic.bmap` file in addition to the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` in order to use `bmaptool`. If this is not available use `USBImager`.

On many distributions `bmap-tools` can be installed using your distros package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install bmap-tools`).

For more information see the [Yocto documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/bmaptool.html) for `bmaptool`.

First of all determine the device `logical name` associated with the SD card on your host:

```
sudo lshw -class disk
```

Use `bmaptool` to copy the image to the SD card. Make sure the `wic` image file and `bmap` file are in the same directory.

```
sudo bmaptool copy ${IMAGE} ${DEVICE}
```

For example:

```
sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1.wic.gz /dev/sda
```


### Flash The QSPI



* Download the `.jic` image from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Power down the board.
* Set **MSEL** dipswitch **S4** on SOM to **JTAG: OFF-OFF**
* Power up the board.
* Program the QSPI with the following command. See: [quartus_pgm command]

    ```bash
    quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "pvi;top.hps.jic" 
    ```


* **(Optional)** Use the Quartus® Programmer GUI

  * Launch the Quartus® Programmer and Configure the **"Hardware Setup..."**
    settings as follows:
  <br>

  ![hw-setup-set](./common/images/hw-setup-set.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

  * Click "Auto Detect", select the device `A5EC065BB32AR0` and press
    **"Change File.."**
  <br>

  ![programmer-agx5](./common/images/programmer-agx5.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

  * Select the `.jic` file you downloaded earlier. The `MT25QU02G` device
    should now show. Select the **"Program/Configure"** box, and press **"Start"**.
    Wait until completed (It could take several minutes).
  <br>

  ![programmer-agx5-2](./common/images/programmer-agx5-2.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

* Power down the board. Set **MSEL** dip switch **S4** on SOM to **ASX4 (QSPI): ON-ON**
<br>



### Build Docker Image

The following steps will need to be run on **both** the Agilex™ 5 development kit HPS **and** the host PC if you wish to run the ROS Visualizer.

!!! note
    An internet connection is required to run the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2.git
cd altera-ros2
docker build -f .docker/Dockerfile -t altera-ros2 .
```

The Docker image should now be available.

```
docker image ls

REPOSITORY                      TAG              IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
altera-ros2                     latest           92816d4b0459   6 weeks ago     3.8GB
```

The resulting Docker image includes the Altera® ROS 2 packages and examples pre-installed and ready to use.

### Run The Example MoveIt Client
We will now deploy an instance of the example [MoveIt client](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2/tree/main/examples/moveit_demo_client) in a container on the HPS using the image we built previously. The [MoveIt client](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2/tree/main/examples/moveit_demo_client) is written in C++ and simply generates random pose goals for a given robot description before attempting to plan and execute a trajectory using the relevant `MoveGroup`. The client makes use of the [`MoveGroupInterface`](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/moveit_ros_planning_interface/html/classmoveit_1_1planning__interface_1_1MoveGroupInterface.html) class making it compatible with various robot arms. In this example we will be launching an instance to control a simulated [UFACTORY Lite 6 robot arm](https://www.ufactory.cc/lite-6-collaborative-robot/).

ROS uses Python based `launch` files to bring up the necessary services and nodes for a given use-case. In this case we will be using the [lite6_moveit_demo.launch.py](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-ros2/blob/main/examples/moveit_demo_client/launch/lite6_moveit_demo.launch.py) launch file which intializes the required controllers, publishers and move groups along with our client application. The result is a fully simulated robot controller implementation with low-level drives handled by the FPGA through the Altera® Drive-on-Chip IP and high-level functionality provided by ROS and MoveIt running on the HPS.

Run the following command on the HPS to start a container passing through the Drive-on-Chip UIO devices used for motor control:

```
docker run -it --rm --network host --device /dev/uio0 --device /dev/uio1 --device /dev/uio2 altera-ros2
```
Next run the following command to launch the example:

```
ros2 launch moveit_demo_client lite6_moveit_demo.launch.py random:=true mode:=doc use_rviz:=false
```

Upon successful initialization you should see a stream of messages similar to that below indicating planning requests are being received by the `MoveGroup` and trajectories are being executed by the relevant controllers.

```
[move_group-3] [INFO]: Motion plan was computed successfully.
[moveit_demo_client-5] [INFO]: Planning request complete!
[moveit_demo_client-5] [INFO]: time taken to generate plan: 0.0128849 seconds
[moveit_demo_client-5] [INFO]: Execute request accepted
[move_group-3] [INFO]: Execution request received
[move_group-3] [INFO]: Starting trajectory execution ...
[move_group-3] [INFO]: sending trajectory to lite6_traj_controller
[ros2_control_node-4] [INFO]: Received new action goal
[ros2_control_node-4] [INFO]: Accepted new action goal
[move_group-3] [INFO]: lite6_traj_controller started execution
[move_group-3] [INFO]: Goal request accepted!
```

### ROS Visualizer (RViz)

In order to visualize what is happening behind the scenes you can use a tool called RViz on your host PC.

For the purposes of this example we will be running RViz in a Docker container using the `altera-ros2` image built earlier. For this we need our Docker container to have access to the display server on the host in order to load a graphical application. To make this easier it is recommended to use [Rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker).

* Follow the official [installation instructions](https://github.com/osrf/rocker#installation) to install [Rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker)
* Once installed run the following command to start RViz

```
rocker --x11 --devices /dev/dri --network host altera-ros2 rviz2
```

!!! note
    If you are using a **Nvidia** graphics card in your host you will need to follow [these additional steps](https://github.com/osrf/rocker#nvidia-settings) and include the `--nvidia` flag in the command above.

* Once RViz has loaded go to the left-hand panel and find `Fixed Frame` under `Global Options`. Select `world` from the drop-down list as in the screenshot below.

<center>

![rviz_fixed_frame](./doc-crc/images/rviz_01.png)

</center>

* Next click the `Add` button at the bottom of the left-hand panel and select `PlanningScene` in the popup window before finally clicking `OK`.

<center>

![rviz_fixed_frame](./doc-crc/images/rviz_02.png)

</center>

At this point you should see a live visualization of the robot arm moving from pose to pose. The planning scene includes a table with the robot arm on top.
