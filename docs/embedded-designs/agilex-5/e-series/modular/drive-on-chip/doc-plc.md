# Drive-On-Chip with PLC Design Example for Agilex™ 5 Devices

## Overview

This example demonstrates:

* Use of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) runtime to control FPGA IP
  via an IEC 61131 PLC application.
* Embedded Real Time Dual Axis motor control in the FPGA fabric.
* Deployment of a Docker container on the Agilex™ SoC HPS running Linux.
* Monitoring the motor drives via the Python GUI and JTAG interface.

### Programmable Logic Controller

The Programmable Logic Controller has been a fundamental component of
industrial automation for decades.  The IEC 61131-3 standard that defines the
programming languages of these devices provides compatibility across different
manufacturers and a familiar programming environment for the technicians who
install and configure them.

The Drive-on-Chip with PLC Design Example for Agilex™ 5 Devices shows how the
PLC programming environment can be used to interface to Motor Control
Soft IP in the FPGA fabric.
The design example combines a PLC Runtime, webserver and multi-axis simulated
motor drives.  The PLC runtime runs PLC applications.  The webserver provides
the interface to monitor the motor drives.
The design includes a motor and power board model on the FPGA that removes the
need for a physical motor setup.

The following diagrams provide an overview of the interaction of software
running on ARM CPUs inside the Hard Processor Subsystem (HPS) and hardware
components running in the programmable logic (FPGA) parts of the device.

For more information of ARM HPS in Altera® Agilex Devices refer to
[User Manuals](#user-manuals) section.

<center>

**High-Level Block Diagram of the Drive-OnChip <br>
with PLC Design Example.**
</center>
<br>

The previous figure shows that the PLC Runtime and webserver run in a Docker
container on the HPS Operating System (OS, Custom Linux). The Docker container
separates the applications from the operating system. The container includes
the runtime libraries and software utilities required by the PLC application
to run.
The connections to the operating system are the only interfaces needed for
the motor control and web interface to execute.

The Drive-On-Chip (DoC) Python GUI monitors the simulated motor axes.
The connection to the Drive-on-Chip IP in the FPGA is a JTAG interface
that bypasses the HPS.  The GUI provides a confirmation of the activity
of the motor axes independent of the software on the HPS.

  The following provides the default configuration for all the switches in the
  board.

![board-1](./common/images/board-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Development Board switch position**
</center>
<br>

!!! note "Main configurations used in this example design"

    JTAG:     SOM SW4[2:1]=OFF:OFF <br>
    ASx4 (QSPI):  SOM SW4[2:1]=ON:ON

<br>

* Connect micro USB cable from bottom left of the carrier board to PC (`J35`).
  This will be used for JTAG communication (see figure below).
* Connect micro USB cable from bottom right of the SOM board to PC
  (`J2`, HSP_UART). This will be used for HPS UART communication. Look at what
  ports are enumerated on your host computer, there should be a series of
  four. Use the 3rd one in the list as the HPS serial port (see figure below).
* If ethernet capabilities or remote connection via `ssh` is required connect an
  ethernet cable to the ethernet port on the SOM board (`J6`, ETH 1G HPS) and make
  sure your device is in the same network as your intended host device. After
  Linux boots, check the IP address of the `end2` ethernet interface using the
  `ip addr` command.

### SD Card Image Flashing

* Download SD card image (`.wic` or `.wic.gz`) from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Write the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` SD card image to the micro SD card using one of the options below.
* Turn off the board and insert the SD card in the micro SD card slot on the SOM board.

#### [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)

* Open [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) and click the `...` button in the top right.
* Select the image you downloaded earlier and click `Open`.
* Next select the device associated with your SD card reader from the drop-down list.
* Click `Write` to start flashing.

#### [bmaptool](https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool) (Linux)

!!! note
    You will require a `.wic.bmap` file in addition to the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` in order to use `bmaptool`. If this is not available use `USBImager`.

On many distributions `bmap-tools` can be installed using your distros package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install bmap-tools`).

For more information see the [Yocto documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/bmaptool.html) for `bmaptool`.

First of all determine the device `logical name` associated with the SD card on your host:

```
sudo lshw -class disk
```

Use `bmaptool` to copy the image to the SD card. Make sure the `wic` image file and `bmap` file are in the same directory.

```
sudo bmaptool copy ${IMAGE} ${DEVICE}
```

For example:

```
sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1.wic.gz /dev/sda
```


### **Expand the SD card Root File System Partition.**

The Root File System partition (`root`, Ext4) may require resizing to
accommodate larger files, such as example design applications. Users can select
their preferred tool to perform this task; however, the following steps
provide instructions using the `Disks` utility (based on `e2fsprogs`):

* Insert the SD card image in the Linux machine that has the `Disks` utility
  installed. You should be able to see the available storage devices.
* Select the `root` partition of the SD card and click the "gear" icon as shown in the
  figure below to display the menu. Navigate to `Resize...`

![disk-imager](./common/images/sd-root-part.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Select the "root" partition for resizing.**
</center>

* Use the slider to increment the partition storage capacity (the maximum is
  recommended). Then, click the `Resize` button.

![disk-imager](./common/images/sd-root-resize.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Resize the root partition to the maximum.**
</center>

* Eject the disk safely.
<br>


### Flash The QSPI

* Download the `.jic` image from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Power down the board.
* Set **MSEL** dipswitch **S4** on SOM to **JTAG: OFF-OFF**
* Power up the board.
* Program the QSPI with the following command.

    ```bash
    quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "pvi;top.hps.jic" 
    ```


* **(Optional)** Use the Quartus® Programmer GUI

  * Launch the Quartus® Programmer and Configure the **"Hardware Setup..."**
    settings as follows:
  <br>

  ![hw-setup-set](./common/images/hw-setup-set.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

  * Click "Auto Detect", select the device `A5EC065BB32AR0` and press
    **"Change File.."**
  <br>

  ![programmer-agx5](./common/images/programmer-agx5.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

  * Select the `.jic` file you downloaded earlier. The `MT25QU02G` device
    should now show. Select the **"Program/Configure"** box, and press **"Start"**.
    Wait until completed (It could take several minutes).
  <br>

  ![programmer-agx5-2](./common/images/programmer-agx5-2.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

* Power down the board. Set **MSEL** dip switch **S4** on SOM to **ASX4 (QSPI): ON-ON**

<br>

* Power up the board and setup the serial terminal emulator (minicom, putty, etc):
  * Select the correct `COMx` port. From the HPS serial UART, select the third
   COM port (out of four).
  * **Serial Port configuration**:
    * Baud rate: 115200, Data bits: 8,
      Stop bits: 1, CRC: disabled, Hardware flow control: disabled
  * Connect your terminal emulator.

<r> To continue, select method a) or method b) to deploy a Docker container image </r>

#### **<r>a)</r> Boot Linux, create a Docker image using the Dockerfile**

* In the Development Kit, wait for Linux to boot, and clone the
  "altera-openplc" repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-openplc.git
    cd altera-openplc
```

* Build the Docker Image (this can take several minutes):

```bash
    docker build -t altera-plc:arm64 .
```

#### **<r>b)</r> Boot Linux, copy and load a cross-compiled Docker container image**

* Follow the instructions provided in [Altera OpenPLC Docker Container Image Cross-compilation.](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-openplc#build-a-docker-image)
  to get a cross-compiled Docker image file (name it `altera-plc.tar.gz`)

* Wait for Linux to boot and query the Development Kit IP address:

``` bash
    ifconfig
```

* The serial terminal should show the following:

<br>

![eth-interface](./common/images/eth-interface.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**Agilex™ 5 Modular Development Kit IP Address.**
</center>
<br>

* Take a note of the board's IP address or `<dk-ip-address>`

* Copy the PLC docker previously generated Docker container image to the board,
  preferably to the `/home/root` directory in the RootFile System. The
  suggested method to do it is using `scp` or `sftp` commands to transfer
  the file from your host machine to the development kit.

```bash
    scp -rp altera-plc.tar.gz root@<dk-ip-address>:/home/root
```

* Load the Image and deploy the PLC Container. To load the Docker Image use the
  following commands (in the Development Kit):

```bash
    docker ps -a
    docker load < altera-plc.tar.gz
```

![docker-load](./doc-plc/images/docker-load.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**Load the PLC Docker image.**
</center>
<br>

#### **Deploy the PLC Container.**

* Verify and deploy the container.

```bash
    docker image ls
    docker run -it --rm --device /dev/uio0 --network host altera-plc:arm64
```

* The following image shows the IP address and port to interface with the
  PLC web-server.

![docker-run](./doc-plc/images/docker-run.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**"docker run" command output.**
</center>
<br>

### **Launching the PLC Webserver and Running an ST file.**

* In a host machine within the same network as the development kit, launch
  a web browser with the address that was shown in the console window
  (usually `http://<dk-ip-address>:8080`) and login. For example in Firefox:

!!! note "Login into the OpenPLC webserver with:"

    username: openplc <br>
    password: openplc

![openplc-login](./doc-plc/images/openplc-login.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**OpenPLC Webserver interface login screen.**
</center>
<br>

* Load the `Agilex Drive On Chip` OpenPLC driver. In the OpenPLC Webserver, navigate
  to `Hardware` and select `Agilex Drive-On-Chip` OpenPLC Hardware Layer. Press
  the `Save Changes` button and let let the compilation finish (it can take a
  few minutes). When done, press the `Go to Dashboard` button at the bottom
  of the page.

![plc-hardware](./doc-plc/images/plc-hardware.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**Agilex™ Drive-On-Chip PLC driver selection.**
</center>
<br>

* In the OpenPLC webserver, navigate to `Programs` tab in the left panel, then
  press `Browse` and load `agilex_doc.st` file (see
  [Binaries](#download-the-minimum-pre-built-binaries)). Press the button
  `Upload Program`. Give the program a name, e.g. "doc-agilex" and press
  `Upload Program` button. Let the compilation finish (this can take a few minutes).

![plc-st-compile](./doc-plc/images/plc-st-compile.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**Structured Text (ST) PLC program load and compile.**
</center>
<br>

* Press the `Go to Dashboard` button to select the `Dashboard` tab and execute
  the `.st` program with the button `Start PLC` in the left panel. The PLC
  Controller will start to run and control the Drive On Chip system in the FPGA fabric.

![start-plc](./doc-plc/images/start-plc.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**Start the PLC-based Drive-On-Chip motion controller.**
</center>
<br>

* In the OpenPLC webserver, in the left panel, navigate to the `Monitoring` tab.
  This will show the dual axes of the "Drive On Chip" being controlled by
  OpenPLC and the PLCopen-based RTMotion Library according to the `.st`
  (structured text) program loaded previously.

![plc-monitoring](./doc-plc/images/plc-monitoring.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**OpenPLC Webserver Monitoring tab for Axis Control Visualization.**
</center>
<br>

!!! note "Create and run your own program: "

    You can create your own `.st` file and load it in the OpenPLC
    Programmable Logic Controller to modify the speed and/or position of
    any of the two drives in the FPGA systems (Dual Axis Drive-On-Chip)

### **Monitoring the DoC through JTAG interface.**

The user can visualize the "Drive On Chip" (DoC) behavior using an independent JTAG
channel. This channel shows the axes speed/position that is being
requested by the PLC Controller. The "Drive On Chip" system exposes these
(and other) values through JTAG chain that can be accessed with a GUI running
in your local host. To visualize the DoC drive control characteristics follow
these steps:

* Keep the Altera® FPGA download cable and JTAG connection to the board.

* Unzip the GUI source code, see [Binaries](#download-the-minimum-pre-built-binaries):

```bash
unzip doc-gui_1.0.0.zip
cd <download>/doc-gui_1.0.0
```

* Open a terminal, install the requirements (if needed) and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python __main__.py
```

* Select the right JTAG master from the menu (if it is not selected automatically).
  Usually AE5(C0…0)...

<br>

![GUI-1](./common/images/GUI-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Select the Agilex™ device in
the JTAG Device dropdown menu.**
</center>
<br>

* When the GUI is running, change to the "Axis" tab, in the left panel. The tab
  shows the speed values of both Axis changing as it is shown in the OpenPLC webserver.
  To see more details, press the `Start Trace` button in the right-bottom of
  the GUI to display speed and position traces.

<br>

![py-gui-plc](./doc-plc/images/py-gui-plc.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
<center>

**Drive On Chip GUI for visualization.**
</center>
<br>

!!! warning

    Do not change speed or position values in the Python GUI. The drives are
    being controlled by the PLC and the GUI should be only used for
    visualization purposes.
