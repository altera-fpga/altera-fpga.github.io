## Overview

This example demonstrates:

* Use of a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) runtime to control FPGA IP
  via an IEC 61131 PLC application.
* Embedded Real Time Dual Axis motor control in the FPGA fabric.
* Deployment of a Docker container on the Agilex™ SoC HPS running Linux.
* Monitoring the motor drives via the Python GUI and JTAG interface.

### Programmable Logic Controller

The Programmable Logic Controller has been a fundamental component of
industrial automation for decades.  The IEC 61131-3 standard that defines the
programming languages of these devices provides compatibility across different
manufacturers and a familiar programming environment for the technicians who
install and configure them.

The Drive-on-Chip with PLC Design Example for Agilex™ Devices shows how the
PLC programming environment can be used to interface to Motor Control
Soft IP in the FPGA fabric.
The design example combines a PLC Runtime, webserver and multi-axis simulated
motor drives.  The PLC runtime runs PLC applications.  The webserver provides
the interface to monitor the motor drives.
The design includes a motor and power board model on the FPGA that removes the
need for a physical motor setup.

The following diagrams provide an overview of the interaction of software
running on ARM CPUs inside the Hard Processor Subsystem (HPS) and hardware
components running in the programmable logic (FPGA) parts of the device.

For more information of ARM HPS in Altera® Agilex™ Devices refer to
[User Manuals](#user-manuals) section.

**High-Level Block Diagram of the Drive-OnChip <br>
with PLC Design Example.**
</center>
<br>

The previous figure shows that the PLC Runtime and webserver run in a Docker
container on the HPS Operating System (OS, Custom Linux). The Docker container
separates the applications from the operating system. The container includes
the runtime libraries and software utilities required by the PLC application
to run.
The connections to the operating system are the only interfaces needed for
the motor control and web interface to execute.

The Drive-On-Chip (DoC) Python GUI monitors the simulated motor axes.
The connection to the Drive-on-Chip IP in the FPGA is a JTAG interface
that bypasses the HPS.  The GUI provides a confirmation of the activity
of the motor axes independent of the software on the HPS.

### SD Card Image Flashing

* Download SD card image (`.wic` or `.wic.gz`) from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Write the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` SD card image to the micro SD card using one of the options below.
* Turn off the board and insert the SD card in the micro SD card slot on the SOM board.

#### [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)

* Open [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) and click the `...` button in the top right.
* Select the image you downloaded earlier and click `Open`.
* Next select the device associated with your SD card reader from the drop-down list.
* Click `Write` to start flashing.

#### [bmaptool](https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool) (Linux)

!!! note
    You will require a `.wic.bmap` file in addition to the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` in order to use `bmaptool`. If this is not available use `USBImager`.

On many distributions `bmap-tools` can be installed using your distros package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install bmap-tools`).

For more information see the [Yocto documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/bmaptool.html) for `bmaptool`.

First of all determine the device `logical name` associated with the SD card on your host:

```
sudo lshw -class disk
```

Use `bmaptool` to copy the image to the SD card. Make sure the `wic` image file and `bmap` file are in the same directory.

```
sudo bmaptool copy ${IMAGE} ${DEVICE}
```

For example:

```
sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1.wic.gz /dev/sda
```


### **Expand the SD card Root File System Partition.**

The Root File System partition (`root`, Ext4) may require resizing to
accommodate larger files, such as example design applications. Users can select
their preferred tool to perform this task; however, the following steps
provide instructions using the `Disks` utility (based on `e2fsprogs`):

* Insert the SD card image in the Linux machine that has the `Disks` utility
  installed. You should be able to see the available storage devices.
* Select the `root` partition of the SD card and click the "gear" icon as shown in the
  figure below to display the menu. Navigate to `Resize...`

![disk-imager](./common/images/sd-root-part.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Select the "root" partition for resizing.**
</center>

* Use the slider to increment the partition storage capacity (the maximum is
  recommended). Then, click the `Resize` button.

![disk-imager](./common/images/sd-root-resize.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Resize the root partition to the maximum.**

<r> To continue, select method a) or method b) to deploy a Docker container image </r>

#### **<r>a)</r> Boot Linux, create a Docker image using the Dockerfile**

* In the Development Kit, wait for Linux to boot, and clone the
  "altera-openplc" repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-openplc.git
    cd altera-openplc
```

* Build the Docker Image (this can take several minutes):

```bash
    docker build -t altera-plc:arm64 .
```

#### **<r>b)</r> Boot Linux, copy and load a cross-compiled Docker container image**

* Follow the instructions provided in [Altera OpenPLC Docker Container Image Cross-compilation.](https://github.com/altera-fpga/altera-openplc#build-a-docker-image)
  to get a cross-compiled Docker image file (name it `altera-plc.tar.gz`)

* Wait for Linux to boot and query the Development Kit IP address:

``` bash
    ifconfig
```

* The serial terminal should show the following:

<br>

* Take a note of the board's IP address or `<dk-ip-address>`

* Copy the PLC docker previously generated Docker container image to the board,
  preferably to the `/home/root` directory in the RootFile System. The
  suggested method to do it is using `scp` or `sftp` commands to transfer
  the file from your host machine to the development kit.

```bash
    scp -rp altera-plc.tar.gz root@<dk-ip-address>:/home/root
```

* Load the Image and deploy the PLC Container. To load the Docker Image use the
  following commands (in the Development Kit):

```bash
    docker ps -a
    docker load < altera-plc.tar.gz
```

</center>
<br>

!!! note "Create and run your own program: "

    You can create your own `.st` file and load it in the OpenPLC
    Programmable Logic Controller to modify the speed and/or position of
    any of the two drives in the FPGA systems (Dual Axis Drive-On-Chip)

### **Monitoring the DoC through JTAG interface.**

The user can visualize the "Drive On Chip" (DoC) behavior using an independent JTAG
channel. This channel shows the axes speed/position that is being
requested by the PLC Controller. The "Drive On Chip" system exposes these
(and other) values through JTAG chain that can be accessed with a GUI running
in your local host. To visualize the DoC drive control characteristics follow
these steps:

* Keep the Altera® FPGA download cable and JTAG connection to the board.

* Unzip the GUI source code, see [Binaries](#download-the-minimum-pre-built-binaries):

```bash
unzip doc-gui_1.0.0.zip
cd <download>/doc-gui_1.0.0
```

* Open a terminal, install the requirements (if needed) and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python __main__.py
```

* Select the right JTAG master from the menu (if it is not selected automatically).
  Usually AE5(C0…0)... (or similar)

<br>

![GUI-1](./common/images/GUI-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Select the Agilex™ device in
the JTAG Device dropdown menu.**
</center>
<br>

* When the GUI is running, change to the "Axis" tab, in the left panel. The tab
  shows the speed values of both Axis changing as it is shown in the OpenPLC webserver.
  To see more details, press the `Start Trace` button in the right-bottom of
  the GUI to display speed and position traces.

<br>

![py-gui-plc](./doc-plc/images/py-gui-plc.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}
