### SD Card Image Flashing

* Download SD card image (`.wic` or `.wic.gz`) from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Write the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` SD card image to the micro SD card using one of the options below.
* Turn off the board and insert the SD card in the micro SD card slot on the SOM board.

#### [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)

* Open [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) and click the `...` button in the top right.
* Select the image you downloaded earlier and click `Open`.
* Next select the device associated with your SD card reader from the drop-down list.
* Click `Write` to start flashing.

#### [bmaptool](https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool) (Linux)

!!! note
    You will require a `.wic.bmap` file in addition to the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` in order to use `bmaptool`. If this is not available use `USBImager`.

On many distributions `bmap-tools` can be installed using your distros package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install bmap-tools`).

For more information see the [Yocto documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/bmaptool.html) for `bmaptool`.

First of all determine the device `logical name` associated with the SD card on your host:

```
sudo lshw -class disk
```

Use `bmaptool` to copy the image to the SD card. Make sure the `wic` image file and `bmap` file are in the same directory.

```
sudo bmaptool copy ${IMAGE} ${DEVICE}
```

For example:

```
sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1.wic.gz /dev/sda
```
