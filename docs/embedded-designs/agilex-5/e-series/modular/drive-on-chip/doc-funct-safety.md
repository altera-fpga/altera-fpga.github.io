# Drive-On-Chip with Functional Safety Design Example for Agilex™ 5 Devices

## Overview

This design demonstrates how to achieve IEC 61508 SIL 2 and ISO 13849 Cat 3 PLd
safety certification using Agilex™ 5 SoC devices. The design is based on the TÜV
Rheinland approved Intel® Cyclone V SoC FPGA Cat 3 PLd and SIL 2 safety concept.

Altera® does not intend you to certify the design. Therefore, Altera® only applies
the safety design process described in IEC 61508 only where relevant. The design
shows how you apply the Altera® SoC FPGA Cat 3 PL d and SIL 2 safety concept. The
architecture is based around a particular component of the drive-on-chip, the
speed limit. You can extend the concept to monitor, cross-compare, and control
other relevant physical and logical variables that are key for safety.

This design demonstrates synchronous control of up to two three-phase permanent
magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) or brushless DC (BLDC) motors. The design
includes a motor and power board model that removes the need for a physical motor
setup.
This design is an extension of the existing Drive-on-Chip Design Example for
Agilex™ 5 Devices. It includes safety function to demonstrate how Agilex™ 5 SoC
devices may achieve IEC 61508 SIL 2 or ISO 13849 Cat 3 PL d safety certification.

You need an Altera® Agilex™ 5 FPGA E-Series 065B Modular Development Kit to run
the design. The motor and power model helps you tune and test the control system
before using a physical power stage. The motor and power board model are based
on the former Tandem Motion 48 V board, described in AN 994 Drive-on-Chip Design
Example for Agilex™ 7 Devices.

The blocks in yellow belong to the original Drive-On-Chip Design Example for
™ 5 Devices. The blocks in green are the implementation of the FPGA safety
channel and the blue blocks are the implementation of the HPS safety channel.
The diagram shows the logic that the design shares between both channels
necessary to process the safety response time (1ms) and for data sharing for cross-comparison.

The following diagrams provide an overview of the interaction of software and
hardware components in this example design.

</center>

### Setting Up your Development Board

* Configure the board switches:
  The following provides the default configuration for all the switches in the
  board.

![board-1](./common/images/board-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Development Board switch position**
</center>
<br>

!!! note "Main configurations used in this example design"

    JTAG:     SOM SW4[2:1]=OFF:OFF <br>
    ASx4 (QSPI):  SOM SW4[2:1]=ON:ON

<br>

* Connect micro USB cable from bottom left of the carrier board to PC (`J35`).
  This will be used for JTAG communication (see figure below).
* Connect micro USB cable from bottom right of the SOM board to PC
  (`J2`, HSP_UART). This will be used for HPS UART communication. Look at what
  ports are enumerated on your host computer, there should be a series of
  four. Use the 3rd one in the list as the HPS serial port (see figure below).
* If ethernet capabilities or remote connection via `ssh` is required connect an
  ethernet cable to the ethernet port on the SOM board (`J6`, ETH 1G HPS) and make
  sure your device is in the same network as your intended host device. After
  Linux boots, check the IP address of the `end2` ethernet interface using the
  `ip addr` command.

**USB connections to the board**
</center>
<br>




### SD Card Image Flashing

* Download SD card image (`.wic` or `.wic.gz`) from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Write the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` SD card image to the micro SD card using one of the options below.
* Turn off the board and insert the SD card in the micro SD card slot on the SOM board.

#### [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)

* Open [USBImager](https://bztsrc.gitlab.io/usbimager/) and click the `...` button in the top right.
* Select the image you downloaded earlier and click `Open`.
* Next select the device associated with your SD card reader from the drop-down list.
* Click `Write` to start flashing.

#### [bmaptool](https://github.com/yoctoproject/bmaptool) (Linux)

!!! note
    You will require a `.wic.bmap` file in addition to the `.wic` or `.wic.gz` in order to use `bmaptool`. If this is not available use `USBImager`.

On many distributions `bmap-tools` can be installed using your distros package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install bmap-tools`).

For more information see the [Yocto documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev-manual/bmaptool.html) for `bmaptool`.

First of all determine the device `logical name` associated with the SD card on your host:

```
sudo lshw -class disk
```

Use `bmaptool` to copy the image to the SD card. Make sure the `wic` image file and `bmap` file are in the same directory.

```
sudo bmaptool copy ${IMAGE} ${DEVICE}
```

For example:

```
sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-agilex5_mk_a5e065bb32aes1.wic.gz /dev/sda
```


### Flash The QSPI

* Download the `.jic` image from the prebuilt binary links above.
* Power down the board.
* Set **MSEL** dipswitch **S4** on SOM to **JTAG: OFF-OFF**
* Power up the board.
* Program the QSPI with the following command.

    ```bash
    quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "pvi;top.hps.jic" 
    ```


* **(Optional)** Use the Quartus® Programmer GUI

  * Launch the Quartus® Programmer and Configure the **"Hardware Setup..."**
    settings as follows:
  <br>

  ![hw-setup-set](./common/images/hw-setup-set.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

  * Click "Auto Detect", select the device `A5EC065BB32AR0` and press
    **"Change File.."**
  <br>

  ![programmer-agx5](./common/images/programmer-agx5.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

  * Select the `.jic` file you downloaded earlier. The `MT25QU02G` device
    should now show. Select the **"Program/Configure"** box, and press **"Start"**.
    Wait until completed (It could take several minutes).
  <br>

  ![programmer-agx5-2](./common/images/programmer-agx5-2.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

  <br>

* Power down the board. Set **MSEL** dip switch **S4** on SOM to **ASX4 (QSPI): ON-ON**

<br>


### **Run the design example**

* Power up the board and setup the serial terminal (minicom, putty, etc):
  * Select the correct `COMx` port. From the HPS serial UART, select the third
  port (out of four). 
  * **Serial Port configuration**:
    * Baud rate: 115200, Data bits: 8,
      Stop bits: 1, CRC: disabled, Hardware flow control: disabled
  * Connect your terminal emulator.
  
* Wait for Linux to boot, the safety application should run after ~30s.
  (No inputs from the user required)

* The serial terminal should show the following:

<br>

<center>

**HPS Safety Function Serial Port Printing.**
</center>
<br>

* Keep the Altera® FPGA download cable and JTAG connection to the board.

<br>

### **Debugging and Monitoring the Safety Function.**

* Unzip the GUI source code:

```bash
    unzip doc-gui_1.0.0.zip
    cd <download>/doc-gui_1.0.0
```

* Open a terminal and run:

```bash
    python __main__.py
```

* Select the right JTAG master from the menu (if it is not selected automatically).
  Usually AE5(C0…0)...

<br>

![GUI-1](./common/images/GUI-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
<center>

**Select the Agilex™ device in
the JTAG Device dropdown menu.**
</center>
<br>

* When the GUI is running, change to the Safety tab, in the left panel, with the
  **!** symbol. The tab summarizes of the safety status of the design.The Safety
  tab shows information about the status of both safety channels, FPGA and HPS.
  The estimated speed, the payload comparison results, the over-speed detection
  and the payload count. The Status widget shows if the motor goes into safe state.

<br>

### **Looking into the Drive-On-Chip Output.**

Additionally, just after few seconds fromt turning the board on, you can observe
the output from the drive-on-chip application that runs in the Nios V/g processor.

* Connect a micro-USB cable to the integrated USB blaster II in the board.
* Run (source the Nios V command shell if required):

``` bash
    juart-terminal -d 2 -i 0
```
